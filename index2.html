	<p>Last week, I went to the Chicago Auto Show and saw a bunch of awesome cars.  My wife and I are actually looking to buy a car soon so it was nice to go and check out a bunch of cars that we were interested in.  Here's a list of the some of the things we're looking for:</p>
			<ol>	 
	    <li>SUV</li>
	    <li>Trunk and back-seat space</li>
	    <li>Safety<i2>
	    <li>Comfort</li>
	  </ol>	

	 <p>So we walked around and looked at a bunch of cars and we narrowed it down to these three:</p>

	 <table>
    	<thead>
    		<tr>
    			<th>Make and Model</th>
    			<th>Car Type</th>
    			<th>Favorite Feature</th>
    		</tr>
    	</thead>
    	<tbody>
	  		<tr>
	  				<td>Audi Q3</td>
	  				<td>Compact SUV</td>
	  				<td>Interior Styling</td>
	  		</tr>
	  		<tr>
	  				<td>Hyundai Santa Fe</td>
	  				<td>Mid-size SUV</td>
	  				<td>Value</td>
	  		</tr>
				<tr>
	  				<td>Subaru Outback</td>
	  				<td>Wagon</td>
	  				<td>Safety</td>
	  		</tr>
  		</tbody>
    </table>
   <p>Here's a picture of the Q3:</p>

	<p>This is my first attempt at designing a website from scratch.  My previous assignment, I was using a lot of existing code from the "walter.html" file.  But this one, I decided to build from scratch.  I'd like to fix the background cause it doesn't look the way I want, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that.</p>
